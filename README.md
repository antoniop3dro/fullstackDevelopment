<h2>🔰 Getting Started</h2>
  
<p>Currently, there are no projects or content in this repository. Stay tuned as I begin my journey and populate this repository with learning resources, projects, and portfolios.</p>
  
<h2>📌 Objectives of Learning</h2>
  
<p>My objectives of learning include mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web development technologies. I aim to build a strong foundation in web development and eventually create professional portfolios to showcase my skills.</p>
  
<h2>📚 Learning Resources</h2>
  
<p>I am currently using a variety of learning resources, including online courses, tutorials, books, and videos, to enhance my skills in web development. Some of the resources I am using include FreeCodeCamp, Angela Yu's Web Development Course, and Origamid.</p>
  
<h2>🔥 Challenges Faced</h2>
  
<p>To be filled as I find challenges.</p>
  
<h2>📅 Future Plans</h2>
  
<p>In the future, I plan to explore advanced topics in web development, such as responsive design, web accessibility, and server-side programming. I also aim to collaborate on open-source projects and contribute to the developer community. My main goal in my career is to work in the cybersecurity area, so ultimately this is a step in the direction of applying good DevOps practices when I learn more about those practices in the future.</p>
